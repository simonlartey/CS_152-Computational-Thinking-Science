##  About This Repository  

This repository contains the code and projects I wrote for my **CS 152: Computational Thinking ‚Äì Science** class.  
In this course, I learned how to use **Python** to describe, model, and solve scientific problems through computation.  
I practiced turning ideas into algorithms, writing code to simulate systems, and analyzing how programs behave through data and visualization.  

The projects in this repository show how I applied computational thinking to topics like **ecological modeling**, **data management**, and **physics-based simulations**.

##  Course Description  

An introduction to computational thinking: how we can describe and solve problems using a computer.  
Using the **Python language**, students learn to write algorithms, manipulate information, and design programs.  
We also explore abstraction, decomposition, and how to describe and analyze processes computationally.  

The projects focus on:  
1. Reading, writing, managing, and analyzing data  
2. Modeling ecological systems using population and agent-based approaches  
3. Simulating physical systems with gravity and collisions

## Projects Overview  

###  Data Management & Analysis  
Programs that read, process, and visualize scientific data.  
I learned how to work with datasets, write reusable functions, and produce plots that reveal patterns and relationships.

###  Ecological Modeling  
Agent-based simulations exploring population growth, predator‚Äìprey dynamics, and ecosystem stability.  
These projects helped me understand how simple computational rules can generate complex behavior in natural systems.

###  Physical Simulations  
Projects modeling motion, collisions, and gravitational systems.  
I used code to simulate physical processes, visualize results, and compare computational predictions to theory.

##  Reflection  

Working on these projects taught me how to **think computationally** ‚Äî to translate real-world processes into code, test hypotheses through simulation, and interpret data programmatically.  
I gained confidence in breaking complex problems into smaller steps, organizing programs clearly, and using Python to explore systems scientifically.  

This course strengthened both my problem-solving mindset and my ability to express ideas through computation.
